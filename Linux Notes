These are my notes for the Linux class.



The "rm" command is to remove
The "mkdir" command is to create a new directory
The "useradd" command is used to create a new user account on the system


=


The userdel command is used to delete a user account on the system.

If we want to see all of the user accounts that are configured on the system, we can read the /etc/passwd file using the command "cat /etc/passwd".
